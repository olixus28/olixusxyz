This very interesting GitHub repository is the home of many projects to come! It will be a place for all my code and resources to be visble in a more visual manner for a less experience end user. 
I wanted my code to be availible to everyone possible and it takes a lot to get your head around GitHub repositories and findinhg complete compiled code!
All my projects to date will be found on tjis website!
